Statistical Physics Explorer
This is a simple interactive web application designed to help users visualize and understand core concepts in statistical physics and thermodynamics.

Features:
Particle Simulation: A 2D simulation of gas particles in a box, where their motion is governed by their kinetic energy.

Real-time Visualization: Watch how particles move and interact based on different parameters.

Interactive Controls: Adjust the temperature and number of particles to see their effects on the system.

Energy Distribution Chart: A live histogram showing the energy distribution of the particles, demonstrating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.

Conceptual Explanations: Learn about key concepts like the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, entropy, and phase transitions with brief, clear descriptions.

Concepts Explored:
Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution: Visualizes how particle energies are distributed in a system at thermal equilibrium.

Entropy & Microstates: Explains how temperature relates to the number of possible particle arrangements (entropy).

Phase Transitions: Describes how a system can undergo dramatic shifts in behavior at critical temperatures.
